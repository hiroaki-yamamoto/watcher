    All operations are like modding.

        Note that you need to copy the directory.

Q.  How can I develop plugins/theme?

Q.  Could you create/code/make/invent/research/study ...
A.  Nope, I'm not interested in it. I'll create programs that I'm interested in it only. Before you ask me to create something,
    you need to make me be interested in it. You have 2 ways to make me be interested in it:
    *)  Offer it as payment jobs.
        I'm a person who is weak in money. Therefore it seems to be the most effective way to make me be interested in it.
        Moreover, I'll completely finish my business as long as I applied your jobs.
        However, DO NOT FORGET I'M NOT A MAMMONIST like a certain company.
        If I can't do your jobs within the technique that I have, or 
        I'm not interested in it though you are willing to pay a lot, I'll refuse your jobs.
        If you have jobs for me, post them via the following address:
            https://www.odesk.com/users/~01f335a1c147aa9d33
            
    *)  Induce me to create it
        It seems to be the most inefficient way to make me be interested in it, because I'm very lazy like your lazy dog.
        Moreover, escaping from the job is possible in progress because I work as a volunteer.
        However, you don't need to pay a lot for the creation.

Q.  Can I send patches?
A.  Sure, patches are welcome, but don't forget I have a choice whether your patches are applied onto an official repository or not.

Q.  Can I send bug reports?
A.  Sure, I know bug reports are very important to improve the software. To repro the bug, you need the following stuff.
    *) The order to repro the bug.
    *) The repetition and timing of the bug.
    *) Setting file (I have a program to check the integrity.)
    *) Unofficial plugins or themes if you have.
    *) GDB Dump file if you are using debug build.

Q. Can I approach feature improvements?
A. I think it is diffrent between feature improvements and create stuff described above.
    The difference is whether the stuff is made from first step or not. For example, plugin creation of watcher is
    categorized in creating stuff, but request to UI improvement is categorized in feature improvements.
    Therefore, it is okay to throw feature improvements and they are welcome.

If you found bugs, please let me know.
